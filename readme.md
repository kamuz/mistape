# Mistape

Mistape allows readers to effortlessly notify site staff about found spelling errors, let your readers notify you about spelling mistakes they may encounter. Make them feel attentive and helpful, and show your care fixing reported errors.

On <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> event, plugin sends selected text along with paragraph and page URL it belongs to an email address selected in admin settings page. You can choose among administrators and editors, or specify another address.

Besides text, caption also can be set as image defined by URL.

Mistape is full of hooks enabling you to modify its behavior the way you like.

All settings are stored in a single database entry and get wiped on plugin uninstall, so you can be sure your WP installation won't be clogged if you decide you don't want Mistape anymore.
